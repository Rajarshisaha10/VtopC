# VtopC

A Flask-based web application that provides a cleaner, more usable interface for VIT Chennai's VTOP student portal. It scrapes and proxies VTOP data through a Python backend, with Firebase authentication and Supabase for data persistence.

---

## What It Does

VTOP's official portal is notoriously painful to use. VtopC acts as a middleware layer — it logs into VTOP on your behalf, scrapes your academic data (attendance, marks, timetable, etc.), and serves it through a cleaner dashboard.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python, Flask |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript (86% of the codebase) |
| Auth | Firebase (client-side), PyJWT, itsdangerous |
| Database | Supabase |
| Scraping | BeautifulSoup4, Requests |
| Deployment | Render (via `render.yaml`) |
| Static Files | WhiteNoise |

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Firebase project
- A Supabase project

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajarshisaha10/VtopC.git
   cd VtopC
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your_strong_random_secret_key

   FIREBASE_API_KEY=
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=

   SUPABASE_URL=
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
   SUPABASE_KEY=
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Deployment (Render)

The `render.yaml` file is already configured for Render. To deploy:

1. Connect your GitHub repo to [Render](https://render.com).
2. Set all environment variables from the `.env` section above in the Render dashboard under **Environment**.
3. Render will automatically run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   gunicorn --workers 3 --timeout 120 app:app
   ```

> **Note:** The free Render tier will spin down after inactivity. Expect cold start delays.

---

## How Authentication Works

1. The app fetches VTOP's login page and extracts a CSRF token.
2. A CAPTCHA image is displayed to the user.
3. On login, credentials + CAPTCHA are POSTed to VTOP's actual login endpoint.
4. On success, credentials are encrypted using `itsdangerous` and stored in an **HttpOnly cookie** (30-day expiry) for auto-login on return visits.
5. VTOP session data is kept in server-side in-memory storage (`session_manager.py`).

> **Important:** Since session storage is in-memory, all sessions are lost on server restart. This is a known limitation of the current design.

---

## Security Notes

- SSL verification is **disabled** (`verify=False`) for requests to VTOP. This is intentional since VTOP's certificate handling is unreliable, but it means traffic between your server and VTOP is not verified.
- The default `SECRET_KEY` in `app.py` is a plaintext fallback. **Never deploy without overriding this with a strong random key in your environment variables.**
- User credentials are stored in a signed (but not encrypted) cookie. Anyone with your `SECRET_KEY` can decode them.
